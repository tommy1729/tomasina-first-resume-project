        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring front end web developer, who is ready to jump into the deep end of this field. I have worked retail for many years, until a untreated medical condition forced me to make a major life and career change. I have always wanted to be in the IT field, but I didn't want to go to school for 100 years to complete a degree program. Having a friend tell me about Treehouse, then looking into the program, was the best decision I have ever made.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work for a web design company that will grow my skills, and allow me to work in Montreal Canada in a few years. .</p>
